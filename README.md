Disclaimer: the original connected vehicle and travel demand data used for the development of this paper contain sensible information, and thus cannot be publicily disclosed. The data snipped provided within this repository contains randomized values for the following columns:
- Connected vehicle data: `n_cornering_right`, `mean_avg_magnitude_cornering_right`, `mean_max_magnitude_cornering_right`, `n_cornering_left`, `mean_avg_magnitude_cornering_left` `mean_max_magnitude_cornering_left`, `n_brake`, `mean_avg_magnitude_brake`, `mean_max_magnitude_brake`, `n_speedup`, `mean_avg_magnitude_speedup`, `mean_max_magnitude_speedup`.
- Travel demand data: `travelDemand_micro`, `travelDemand_privateVehicle`.

The remaining columns have been obtained from the public sources listed in the article.

`u`, `v` and `key` are used to identify each edge.
